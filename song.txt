There goes my valentine again
Soaked in red for what she said
And now she's gone!
Oh my god have I done it again?!
There's a pulse and it's deafening!
I can't help what I hear in my head!
It's the switch that I flick (they said)

Hand of blood!
I don't want to feel, my heart is breaking
Hand of blood!
I don't want to see, my life is burning!
